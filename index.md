## Welcome to Midwest Finest Basketball!
The first thing you will notice about Midwest Finest Basketball is that the organization is different! It is unlike any other club basketball or AAU program you've ever been associated with.

Our club is not geared towards wins and losses, but targeted directly at player development from all aspects of a player's life. Our overall objective is to get each and every player's college education paid for by their ability to play the game of basketball. To do this takes dedication and a commitment from the coaching staff, the player and the player's family.

MWF's sole focus is the student-athlete.  If you are looking for an organization that is transparent, clearly communicates with its members and that will set in motion a clearly defined path to success, you can find a home with Midwest Finest.
